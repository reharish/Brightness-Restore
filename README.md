# Bright-Res
The Script used to resolve brightness restoring issue mainly in kali-linux, ubuntu-mate and other OS using Xfce4 and Mate desktop environments

## Installation
Run the Script with sudo permission
`sudo bash install.sh`
### Note:
select a appropriate graphics device while an installation.
In my case my driver is `amdgpu_bl0` you can see yours by listing `ls /sys/class/backlight/` folder
